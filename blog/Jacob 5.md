<img src="olive tree.jpg" alt="Alt text" title="Olive Tree" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0 auto; max-width: 600px">

When speaking of [Jacob 5 from The Book of Mormon][1], Joseph Fielding Smith said, "No greater parable was ever recorded"


# Context
Just before Jacobs speaks the allegory of the olive trees, he shares something about the "unsearchableness of God" saying, 

> Behold, great and marvelous are the works of the Lord. How unsearchable are the depths of the mysteries of him; and it is impossible that man should find out all his ways. And no man knoweth of his ways save it be revealed unto him; wherefore, brethren, despise not the revelations of God.     
> Jacob 4:8

So we already begin with the caveat that we will not be able to fully comprehend this allegory and whatever we do comprehend will be by the Holy Ghost.

And a little later is a prophecy of the Jews rejecting Jesus
> the Jews they will reject the stone upon which they might build and have safe foundation  
> Jacob 4:15

Then we have a verse as to the purpose of the allegory

> 17 And now, my beloved, how is it possible that these, after having rejected the sure foundation, can ever build upon it, that it may become the head of their corner?   
> Jacob 5:18

# Allegory


Jacob begins by declaring that he will be quoting the prophet [Zenos][2].

> 1 Behold, my brethren, do ye not remember to have read the words of the prophet Zenos, which he spake unto the house of Israel, saying:

> 2 Hearken, O ye house of Israel, and hear the words of me, a prophet of the Lord.

The allegory begins by describing The House of Israel as an Olive Tree which a man nourished until it got old and began to decay.

> 3 For behold, thus saith the Lord, I will liken thee, O house of Israel, like unto a tame olive tree, which a man took and nourished in his vineyard; and it grew, and waxed old, and began to decay.

Once it started to decay the master of the vineyard pruned it, digged about it and nourished it and it grew young and tender branches, but the top was still decaying.

> 4 And it came to pass that the master of the vineyard went forth, and he saw that his olive tree began to decay; and he said: I will prune it, and dig about it, and nourish it, that perhaps it may shoot forth young and tender branches, and it perish not.


> 5 And it came to pass that he pruned it, and digged about it, and nourished it according to his word.

> 6 And it came to pass that after many days it began to put forth somewhat a little, young and tender branches; but behold, the main top thereof began to perish.

Then the master commanded His servant to get branches from the wild olive tree and take.

> 7 And it came to pass that the master of the vineyard saw it, and he said unto his servant: It grieveth me that I should lose this tree; wherefore, go and pluck the branches from a wild olive tree, and bring them hither unto me; and we will pluck off those main branches which are beginning to wither away, and we will cast them into the fire that they may be burned.
