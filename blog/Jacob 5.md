When speaking of [Jacob 5 from The Book of Mormon][1], Joseph Fielding Smith said, "No greater parable was ever recorded"



# Context
Just before Jacobs speaks the allegory of the olive trees, he shares something about the "unsearchableness of God" saying, 

> Behold, great and marvelous are the works of the Lord. How unsearchable are the depths of the mysteries of him; and it is impossible that man should find out all his ways. And no man knoweth of his ways save it be revealed unto him; wherefore, brethren, despise not the revelations of God.     
> Jacob 4:8

So we already begin with the caveat that we will not be able to fully comprehend this allegory and whatever we do comprehend will be by the Holy Ghost.

Then we have a verse as to the purpose of the allegory

> 17 And now, my beloved, how is it possible that these, after having rejected the sure foundation, can aever build upon it, that it may become the head of their corner?   
> Jacob 5:18
