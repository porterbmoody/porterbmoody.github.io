It's a big question and can't be fully answered with a simple one liner or one size fits all solution. We're gonna take a stab at answering this question. 

Hank Smith and John Bytheway dove into this question during the Job episode of Come Follow Him. 

It is a question every believer asks at some point during their lifetime. There is so much suffering in the world. Job is one example of a righteous person who suffered many afflictions. There are examples of righteous people who suffered greatly, unrighteous people who suffered greatly. People who's suffering was a result of their own actions, and people who's suffering was a result of others actions, or just happened. Whatever the category, everyone experiences suffering to some degree in their lifetimes. 

# Righteous who suffer
Many disciples of Jesus have gone through great trials and afflictions for the God's sake. Examples of these disciples include: 

- Joseph Smith
    During his time in Liberty jail, The Prophet Joseph Smith asked God where He was. 

    D&C 121
    > 1 O God, where art thou? And where is the pavilion that covereth thy bhiding place?

    And God responded.

    > 7 My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;

    > 8 And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes.


- Job

    Job was cursed with afflictions so bad he wished he were never born. 

- Peter
- Jesus Christ


- And many more...

# Those who never knew God who suffer
