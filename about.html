<p>My name is Porter and I went to BYU - Idaho to study Data science with a math minor. I grew up in Colorado, served a mission in Charlotte, North Carolina Spanish speaking, but I didn't finish my entire mission so I did the service mission for a while. </p>

<p> love digging deeper into the doctrine to really try to understand what the scriptures are 
    saying and what God's interactions and dealings with his people mean. 
    I love programming in python, r, SQL, and learing about statistics, machine learning algorithms. 
    Linear algebra is the most fascination math topic I have ever studied. </p>

<p> purpose of this blog is to share some of those findings and insights I come 
    across that may help someone getting a fuller grasp of the gospel, history or any topic in between. 
    Another purpose is to help people realize that there actually is a Balm in Gilead. </p>
