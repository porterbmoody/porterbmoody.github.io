<p>My name is Porter and I went to BYU - Idaho to study Data science with a math minor. I grew up in Colorado, served a mission in Charlotte, North Carolina Spanish speaking, but I didn't finish my entire mission so I did the service mission for a while. Once I was done with the service mission I still didn't finish the entire 2 years though. 

I love digging deeper into the doctrine to really try to understand what the scriptures are saying and what God's interactions and dealings with his people mean. 

I love programming in python, r, SQL, and learing about statistics, machine learning algorithms. Linear algebra is the most fascination math topic I have ever studied. 

The purpose of this blog is to share some of those findings and insights I come accross that may help someone getting a fuller grasp of the gospel, history or any topic in between. Another purpose is to help people realize that there actually is a Balm in Gilead. </p>
