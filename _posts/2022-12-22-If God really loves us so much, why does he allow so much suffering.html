<p>It's a big question and can't be fully answered with a simple one liner or one size fits all solution. We're gonna take a stab at answering this question. </p>
<p>It is a question every believer asks at some point during their lifetime. There is so much suffering in the world. Job is one example of a righteous person who suffered many afflictions. There are examples of righteous people who suffered greatly, unrighteous people who suffered greatly. People who's suffering was a result of their own actions, and people who's suffering was a result of others actions, or just happened. Whatever the category, everyone experiences suffering to some degree in their lifetimes. </p>
<h2>Righteous who suffer</h2>

<p>Many disciples of Jesus have gone through great trials and afflictions for the God's sake. Examples of these disciples include: </p>

<ul>
    <li>
    <p>Joseph Smith</p>
    <p>    During his time in Liberty jail, The Prophet Joseph Smith asked God where He was. </p>
        D&C 121
        <q> 1 O God, where art thou? And where is the pavilion that covereth thy bhiding place?</q>
        And God responded.
        <q> 7 My son, peace be unto thy soul; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment;</q>
        <q> 8 And then, if thou endure it well, God shall exalt thee on high; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes.</q>
    </li>
    <li>
    Job
        Job was cursed with afflictions so bad he wished he were never born. 

    </li>
    <li>
    Peter
    </li>
    <li>
    Jesus Christ
    </li>
    
</ul>


- And many more...
In many cases, the suffering of these individuals </p>
<h2>Unrighteous who suffer</h2>
<h2>Those who never knew God who suffer</h2>





Hank Smith and John Bytheway dove into this question during the Job episode of Come Follow Him. They quoted Victor Frankyl show said,
