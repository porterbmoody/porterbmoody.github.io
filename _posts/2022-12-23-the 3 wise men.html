<h1>The Wise men of the East</h2>

<p>
    A group of men (It is not known how many) were guided from a land East of Palestine.
    It is evident they were men of strong spiritual strength because they noticed, and recognized the star of Jesus' birth. 
    It is also likely that they came from a branch of the Lord's people and then returned to bear witness of the birth of Christ.

<p>
    THERE ARE two traditions. The first, referred to in the carol 'We Three Kings', 
    interprets the gifts as symbolising three aspects of Christ's future life: 
    gold to pay for the stable, the frankincense to perfume it and the myrrh as an ointment for the new-born baby.
    <br>
    These are not the gifts Jesus asks of us. From the treasure of our hearts Jesus asks that we give of ourselves: 
    ‘Behold, the Lord requireth the heart and a willing mind’”

    The story of the three wise men who traveled to the birth of Jesus 
    is a wonderful story with rich and inspiring symbolism.
