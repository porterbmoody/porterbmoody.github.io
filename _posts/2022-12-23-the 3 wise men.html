<h1>The Wise men of the East</h2>

    <h2>Who were the wise men?</h2>
    A group of men (It is not known how many) were guided from a land East of Palestine.
    It is evident they were men of strong spiritual strength because they noticed, and recognized the star of Jesus' birth. 
    It is also possible that they came from a branch of the Lord's people 
    and then returned to bear witness of the birth of Christ. 
    The wise men were actually called Magi which means mistics. 
    <!-- Persian or babylonian jews.  -->
    They go immediately after they see the star. 
    They made their way so that about 7 weeks later they find 
    Mary and Joseph in Bethlehem with the child. This means they were not actually there on the night of His birth. 

    <h2>The Star</h2>
    We have Old testament and Book of Mormon references to a physical star being shown.
    Once the wise men saw the star they immediately recognized it and started their 7 week journey to Bethlehem. 

    <!-- Luke 2 Jesus is circumcised 8 days. In Luke 2 -->
    <!-- 6 weeks later Jesus is taken to the temple. Shortly after the temple episode -->



    The East was mesopotamia. 
    <br>
    <h2>The Gifts</h2>
    Gold representing kingship, frankincense (worship) and myrrh (death and mourning).
    These are not the gifts Jesus asks of us. From the treasure of our hearts Jesus asks that we give of ourselves: 
    ‘Behold, the Lord requireth the heart and a willing mind’”

    <h2>The meaning</h2>
    There is significance in the fact that the Wise Men sought Jesus. 
    There were few who sought honestly Jesus and were blessed with a true sign of Him and ultimately the 
    opportunity to see Him as a child. 

    <!-- The story of the three wise men who traveled to the birth of Jesus  -->
    <!-- is a wonderful story with rich and inspiring symbolism. -->
