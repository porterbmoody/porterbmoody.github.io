    <h2>Who were the wise men?</h2>
    A group of men (It is not known how many) were guided from a land East of Palestine.
    It is evident they were men of strong spiritual strength because they noticed, and recognized the star of Jesus' birth. 
    It is also possible that they came from a branch of the Lord's people 
    and then returned to bear witness of the birth of Christ. 
    The wise men were actually called Magi which means mistics. 

    <h2>The Star</h2>
    <img src="/img/posts/star.jpg" alt="awesome pic" align="left">
    <p style="float:right"> 
    Helaman 14:5 prophecies of the star being a sign of Jesus.
    <q>5 And behold, there shall a new star arise, such an one as ye never have beheld; and this also shall be a sign unto you.
    </q>
    Once the wise men saw the star they immediately recognized it and started their 7 week journey to Bethlehem. 
    They initially arrived in Jerusalem and met King Herod. 
    They then acquired of Herod where Jesus was born and King Herod told them to go to Bethlehem and once they see
    Jesus to return and inform him so Herod could go a worship too. 
    So the wise men traveled to Bethlehem and saw the star above the stable. </p>
    
    <br>
    Mathew 2:7
    <q>10 When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.</q>
    <br>

    After having seen Jesus, they were warned in a dream not to return to Herod so they went their way back home.
    Mary and Joseph then parted for Egypt because the Lord told them King Herod would seek to kill the baby Jesus.
    Once Herod realized the wise men did not return and give word to him 
    about the location of Jesus, he had every child of age 2 and under killed.

    <h2>The Gifts</h2>
    Gold representing kingship, frankincense (worship) and myrrh (death and mourning).
    These are not the gifts Jesus asks of us. From the treasure of our hearts Jesus asks that we give of ourselves: 
    ‘Behold, the Lord requireth the heart and a willing mind’”

    <h2>The meaning</h2>
    There is significance in the fact that the Wise Men sought Jesus. 
    There were few who sought honestly Jesus and were blessed with a true sign of Him and ultimately the 
    opportunity to see Him as a child.
